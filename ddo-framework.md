# DDO Framework – Domain-Driven Orchestration

## 🧠 Vision

**Domain-Driven Orchestration (DDO)** is an open-source framework designed to orchestrate AI agents, GenAI pipelines, and intelligent systems across regulated, complex, and high-scale environments.

DDO is **not** another chatbot wrapper.  
It’s the **missing infrastructure** layer for building **governable, modular, explainable intelligent systems**.

## 📐 Core Architecture

### 1. Domain Layer
- Models business or operational context (e.g. finance, healthcare, legal).
- Encodes domain-specific rules, logic, and policies.
- Enables domain-specific agents and tools.

### 2. Agent Runtime & Memory Layer
- Executes multi-step reasoning agents with tool calling.
- Integrates with LLMs (open/proprietary) + memory (Redis, vector DBs, file systems).
- Includes tracing, decision logs, and prompt templating.

### 3. Governance & Compliance Layer
- Built-in audit trails, explainability, and policy enforcement.
- Aligns with GDPR, AI Act, MiCA.
- Tenant-aware telemetry and compliance-first observability.

### 4. Tooling & Plugin Interface
- Plugin system for APIs, models, external tools, databases.
- Official support for OpenAI, watsonx.ai, RAG, search, and automation tools.
- Easily extendable with custom plugins.

### 5. Developer & Operations Layer
- CLI + Web UI (in progress).
- Helm charts, Kubernetes-native, OpenShift-ready.
- YAML-first but user-friendly — built for data scientists, DevOps, and enterprise teams.
