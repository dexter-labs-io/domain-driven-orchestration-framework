# DDO – Domain-Driven Orchestration

**DDO** is a modular orchestration framework for GenAI systems.  
It’s designed to help developers, architects, and enterprises build **governable, memory-aware, and scalable agentic systems**.

> Not a wrapper. Not a chatbot.  
> This is the missing infrastructure layer for intelligent software.

---

## 🚀 Why DDO?

Today’s GenAI landscape is fragmented, ungoverned, and hard to scale.

DDO provides a structured control plane to:
- Compose and orchestrate LLM-based agents and tools
- Enforce governance and compliance (GDPR, AI Act, MiCA)
- Support observability, memory, and domain-specific logic
- Deploy across open environments: Kubernetes, OpenShift, OSS clouds

---

## 🔧 Key Capabilities

- **Domain-Centric Design:** Define logic, tools, and agents per business domain
- **Agent Runtime:** Multi-step agents with tool calling and memory
- **Governance & Telemetry:** Built-in tracing, audit, explainability
- **Plugin System:** Extend with LLMs, APIs, databases, search, or enterprise tools
- **Developer & DevOps Friendly:** CLI, YAML, Helm, Kubernetes-native
